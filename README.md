 ## variable
    1. which will store variable
    2. address of a value

    syntax: variable=value

      in python of need to know the memory location of that varible for that we are using one method that method called id method--> id()

    **** Rules ****
      1. don't start with digits or symbols--> 123a , @abc
      2. starting letter should be alphabets and underscore --> abc , abc12 , _abc
      3.case sensitive --> if small letter we have to call the small letter or vise versa
